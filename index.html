    <p>Dr Norman Borlaug, third from the left, trains biologists in Mexico on how to increase wheat yields - part of his life-long war on hunger.</p><br></div>
    <br>
    <div class="tl"><h2>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h2>
    <br><br>
<ul class="mr">
    <li>1914 - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li><br>
    <li>1933 - Leaves his family's farm to attent the University of Minnesota,<br> thanks to a Depression era program known as the "National Youth<br> Administration"</li><br>
    <li>1935 - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian <br> Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed <br> them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."</li><br>
    <li>1937 - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</li><br>
    <li>1938 - Marries wife of 69 years Marget Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget <br> cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under <br> Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.</li><br>
    <li>1941 - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is <br> rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT <br> to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.</li><br>
    <li>1942 - Receives a Ph.D in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li><br>
    <li>1944 - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his <br> pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. <br> Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease <br> resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on <br> Earth.</li><br>
    <li>1945 - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat <br> yields</li><br>
    <li>1953 - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeildling <br> American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on <br> to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li><br>
    <li>1962 - Visits Delhi and brins his high-yielding strains of wheat to the <br> Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly <br> expanding population</li><br>
    <li>1970 - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li><br>
    <li>1983 - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and <br> sorghum yields</li><br>
    <li>1984 - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</li><br>
    <li>2005 - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." <br> Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the <br> demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently <br> dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals <br> for a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the <br> best breeds."</li><br>
    <li>2009 - dies at the age of 95.</li><br>
